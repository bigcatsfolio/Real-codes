# Pool of Programs and their real applications along with time and space complexities. Open for Efficiency/Optimization and new test cases.

Efficiency : How well a solution uses resources like time , space and energy

Optimization : Best Possible Solution by fine-tuning where resources can be compromised

Note : A readable and maintainable program is more desirable than a slightly "optimized" but less clear version.
